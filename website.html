<h1>Penguin Universe</h1>

<p>Penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere,</p>
<p>with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water,</p>
<p>penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins</p>
<p>feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half</p>
<p>of their lives on land and half in the oceans.</p>

<p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold</p>
<p>climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are</p>
<p>in the temperate zone, and one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, lives near the equator.</p>
